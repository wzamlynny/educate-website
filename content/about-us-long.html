<h2>About Us</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Educate the Future was launched on February 13, 2016 as a community movement to provide all children with free, high-quality, educational opportunities during their time in K-12. Our primary service will be our unique combination of free tutoring and mentoring, but will also be followed up by free community workshops and seminars to offer skill building opportunities. We believe that education is one of the most meaningful and life changing experiences, and move to ensure that all children have an opportunity to succeed. We are eager to begin working within communities to (1) organize our community resources to provide free tutoring and mentoring to children, (2) connect the resources of local businesses and corporations to update and revamp the quality of education being offered, and (3) generate curriculum and policy recommendations to create long-lasting change at a local, state, and federal level. We urge you to join us in this movement for high-quality, educational opportunities.</p>

        <h4><li>Direct Service</li></h4>
        <p>Educate the Futureâ€™s main service is free, high-quality tutoring and mentoring to our children. Thus, students will receive a minimum of one hour of tutoring per week, and sessions will be conducted at the partnered school after classes end. Furthermore, half an hour after the tutoring session will be dedicated to checking in on the student, allowing our students to speak more personally with their tutor; this is an important step in our mentoring process. If funding permits, snacks and drinks will be bought and provided for their time together. To further build on a mentoring relationship, a minimum of one hour of bonding time will be scheduled every week to take place on school premises. What this looks like will change dependent upon shared interests which will have been considered when matching our students and tutors. Keeping in mind that the field of education is ever changing, we will be training our tutors on a monthly basis with programming developed by staff through the advisement of specialized advisors from the field of education, ranging from special-needs training to effective counseling. Alongside our tutoring services, we aim to provide workshops for both children, family, and community members. These workshops will range in focus but will generally aim to facilitate necessary life skills which are not primarily focused upon in K-12 for our children (e.g. resume building, basic finance management, legal study, etc.); provide relationship, life-oriented workshops for families (e.g. effective counseling, finance management, health and dietary planning, etc.); and instruct in technical skills for future job employment (e.g. programming, cooking, psychology, etc.). In consideration for the growing need of effective school resources, Educate the Future will also contact schools to develop a list of needed resources and supplies broken down into three categories: needs, wants, and wishes. With this list in hand, we will reach out to businesses and corporations on behalf of schools to request and receive donated items. Funding for this step will primarily come, once again, from local sponsorships and individual contributions after all costs involving tutoring sessions have been covered.</p>
        <h4><li>Long-Lasting Change</li></h4>
        <p>Educate the Future will generate qualitative and quantitative data from the personal and social progression of our children, tutors, families, teaching staff, and community members over the duration of their involvement with the organization. We will also conduct nation-wide research into best practices in tutoring and schooling, while also comparing legislation throughout the nation and analyzing policy cross-demographically. This data will then be compiled into detailed reports which will be published in multiple formats (e.g. video, whitepaper, etc.) in order to reach a wider audience, and will then be disseminated into our communities through workshops, seminars, and town halls meeting. Meanwhile, our Research, Policy, and Curriculum Department will take these findings to create guidelines and recommendations for effective education policy, tutoring strategies, and allocation of resources. These recommendations will also take into account the recommendations made by specialist advisors who will sit in for the process in collaboration with our Assistant Director of Engagement and their task force. Once policy and legislative recommendations have been created, we will take them to local, state, and federal offices to lobby and advocate for effective and comprehensive change in education. In terms of funding, we will seek to use leftover funds from sponsorships, only after all costs associated with tutoring sessions have been covered. This is also the same for any funds being used from individual contributions. Lastly, we will also seek to apply for grant funding, when available.</p>
