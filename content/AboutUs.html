<h2>About Us</h2>
<span></span>
<p>Educate the Future is committed to fighting for educational justice by addressing the &ldquo;school-to-prison pipeline,&rdquo; a national pattern in which children are funneled into the juvenile and criminal justice systems rather than receiving a holistic education and meaningful life coaching. In order to take action, Educate the Future relies on volunteers from within every community to provide free, high-quality tutoring and mentoring to low-income families regardless of social background (e.g. racial, documentation status, etc.). Tutors are recruited anywhere from their last year in high-school (with parental permission) and on, as long as there is a strength in the academic area of the tutor&rsquo;s choice (e.g. mathematics, history, English, Spanish, etc.), a displayed passion for the future success of children, and ability to pass a background check to ensure the safety of our children. After approval, tutors will be matched locally with a maximum of three (3) children to conduct sessions at a local, public location (e.g. library, community center, etc.). While this direct service is the primary goal of Educate the Future, we also seek to influence policy makers to begin investing in public education rather than in expanding the criminal justice system. To this end, Educate the Future will also aim to collect data, both quantitative and qualitative (e.g. changes in GPA, changes in child&rsquo;s confidence, etc.), from the results of the tutoring sessions over the course of its operations in order to create detailed reports and studies as an evidential foundation for effective change in policy.</p>
<h3>Three Steps for Change</h3>
    <ol start="1">
        <h4><li>Recruitment of Volunteer Tutors and In-Need Families</li></h4>
        <p>Educate the Future will actively be recruiting tutors and families throughout separate time frames. Tutors will be recruited on a rolling basis until staffing for our service is deemed sufficient by the Executive Board and Board of Directors. Families will be recruited anywhere from the beginning to middle of an academic year (July-December). All applications will be reviewed and decided upon during an Executive Board Meeting. Preference among families will be based primarily upon a child’s academic standing; however, a formula will be developed in order to take into account a family’s financial standing, whereas preference will be given to those at a lower standing.</p>
        <h4><li>Direct Service and Personal-, Professional-Development Workshops</li></h4>
        <p>Educate the Future’s main service is high-quality tutoring to our children. Keeping in mind that the field of education is ever changing, we will be training our tutors on a monthly basis with programming developed by staff through the advisement of specialized advisors from the field of education, ranging from special-needs training to effective counseling. Alongside our tutoring services, we aim to also provide workshops for both children and family members. These workshops will range in focus, but will generally aim to facilitate necessary life skills which are not primarily focused upon in K-12 for our children (e.g. resume building, basic finance management, legal study, etc.), while also providing relationship, life-oriented workshops for families (e.g. effective counseling, finance management, health and dietary planning, etc.).</p>
        <h4><li>Long-Lasting, Effective Policy and Curriculum Advocacy</li></h4>
        <p>Educate the Future will continue to collect data on the personal and social progression of our children, tutors, and families over the duration of their involvement with the organization. This data will then be compiled into detailed reports which will be published in multiple formats (e.g. video, whitepaper, etc.) in order to reach a wider audience. Our Committee on Policy and Curriculum (CPC) will then take our findings, and the findings from other public reports, and create guidelines and recommendations for effective education policy, as well as recommend changes to curriculum after a meta-analysis of the success and failures of curriculums from several school districts. These recommendations will also take into account the recommendations made by specialist advisors who will also sit on the CPC and contribute as experts in their own areas of expertise.</p>
