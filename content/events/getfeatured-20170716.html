    We are now accepting work relating to education. You do not have to have a background in education; however, your piece of work must be about the field of education. Creativity is completely up to you! You can speak about the faults of education and the need for change, or you can show a view of optimism and instances of success during our current system. Send your work to the email below, we will review it, and then let you know if it will be featured on our site (along with overall feedback)! Please share this news with anyone interested in seeing their work promoted! Good luck and get creative!!
