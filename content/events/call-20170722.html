<p>
We will be hosting another live conference call on Saturday, July 22nd, at 8:00 PM EST to go over our next steps for preparing to launch this coming fall of 2017. This will serve as an opportunity to help us get feedback on our methods and steps towards a successful launch. This presentation will include an overview and breakdown of our estimated budget for the academic year, 2017-2018, as well as an overview of our fundraising campaign which will launch the same day. We will also continue to promote our open positions that anyone can apply for! There is no obligation to join the movement when coming onto the call, so invite friends and family who would be interested. Please share this event and let us know that you'll be there!

    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>Please make sure to click on the left side where it says "General" under "Voice Channels" so that your mic is synched and we can hear you.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Call Etiquette</h3>
<ul>
    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>Mics are fine to use before the presentation begins, and at the end during the Q&A session.</li>
    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>Please keeps mics muted during the duration of the presentation. This is so any background noise is prevented and all participants can hear clearly.</li>
    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>If you have any questions during the presentation, type your questions into the chat and we will get to them as we are present. This is an interactive presentation so please feel free to type as many questions as you like.</li>
    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>During the open mic Q&A, please type "Question" into the chat to let me know you want to turn on your mic to ask a question. This will allow us to have an order of who will ask a question first without anyone being cut off or discouraged to speak. We encourage you to keep your mic on when we answer your question, but just be aware that we will ask you to mute the mic if there is any background noise.</li>
    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>Obvious one, please be respectful of all people in the call! We take this one seriously so we will ban people from the call if they persist after warnings. We doubt this will be an issue, but we wanted to make our stance on this very clear.</li>
    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>This call is meant to help motivate and inspire you to make change in your community, regardless of whether or not you join our movement. Ask any questions that come to mind and feel free to come early or stay late to talk with other participants (all of you share a similar passion so why not).</li>
