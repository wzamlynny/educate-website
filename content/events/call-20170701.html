<p>
    For the past year and some months, we have been working on planning an initiative called "Educate the Future," a community movement to (1) organize our community resources to provide free tutoring and mentoring to children in low-income neighborhoods during their time in K-12, (2) connect the resources of local businesses and corporations to update and revamp the quality of education being offered, and (3) generate curriculum and policy recommendations to create long-lasting change at a local, state, and federal level. We want to open this up to all of you and include anyone interested in creating change for our children. If you would like to learn more about this project, and possibly jump on board in a capacity to help secure a better future for children throughout the country, then make sure to join our call. At the moment, we are planning to set up small pilots within a limited number of schools in New Jersey (where we have ties and connections to leverage) just as a starting off point, but we have all the intention of growing and replicating this throughout the country once we show our success. You do not have to live in New Jersey to get involved; we want your expertise, knowledge, and passion for education above all else! Please join us this coming Saturday, 7/1, at 8:00 PM EST on our call where we will explain our mission and goals in more detail, along with a more detailed breakdown of the available positions.

<h3>Call Etiquette</h3>
<ul>
    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>Mics are fine to use before the presentation begins, and at the end during the Q&A session.</li>
    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>Please keeps mics muted during the duration of the presentation. This is so any background noise is prevented and all participants can hear clearly.</li>
    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>If you have any questions during the presentation, type your questions into the chat and we will get to them as we are present. This is an interactive presentation so please feel free to type as many questions as you like.</li>
    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>During the open mic Q&A, please type "Question" into the chat to let me know you want to turn on your mic to ask a question. This will allow us to have an order of who will ask a question first without anyone being cut off or discouraged to speak. We encourage you to keep your mic on when we answer your question, but just be aware that we will ask you to mute the mic if there is any background noise.</li>
    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>Obvious one, please be respectful of all people in the call! We take this one seriously so we will ban people from the call if they persist after warnings. We doubt this will be an issue, but we wanted to make our stance on this very clear.</li>
    <li><span class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></span>This call is meant to help motivate and inspire you to make change in your community, regardless of whether or not you join our movement. Ask any questions that come to mind and feel free to come early or stay late to talk with other participants (all of you share a similar passion so why not).</li>
