                    <p>Educate the Futureâ€™s method for direct service and long-term change is based on a collaborative approach which will always include the community in decision making in regards to refining our services and the creation and use of our reports and publications. Our goal is to ensure that our organization remains as transparent as possible, and that families and communities we operate with are able to provide as much feedback in regards to our operations. Whether it be through surveys, progress summaries, family meetings, or town halls, Educate the Future will work alongside communities to advocate on a local, state, and federal level in the field of access to high-quality education. Family Meetings will be held every month, on the last Saturday, to provide all families with direct contact to the Executive Board, being free to provide feedback and express any of their needs for additional services. Reports from this meeting will be distributed to all staff and advisers so that all levels of the organization are made aware of potential obstacles, allowing for a greater degree of input in our collaborative structure.</p>
                    <p>We also believe immensely in the notion that true change can only come about when communities are empowered. Thus, we also move to provide free workshops and seminars to all members of the community. These workshops will range in focus but will generally aim to facilitate necessary life skills which are not primarily focused upon in K-12 for our children (e.g. resume building, basic finance management, legal study, etc.); provide relationship, life-oriented workshops for families (e.g. effective counseling, finance management, health and dietary planning, etc.); and instruct in technical skills for future job employment (e.g. programming, cooking, psychology, etc.). Furthermore, we believe wholeheartedly that children outside of our program deserve high-quality education. Thus, Educate the Future will also contact schools to develop a list of needed resources and supplies broken down into three categories: needs, wants, and wishes. With this list in hand, we will reach out to businesses and corporations on behalf of schools to request and receive donated items. For example, we will seek out corporations and businesses which provide the necessary textbooks for classes and request that the most up-to-date books be provided to the schools. In this way, we are able to improve the overall quality of education without over extending and taking on too many students beyond our funding capacity.</p>
