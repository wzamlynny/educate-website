                    <p>Educate the Futureâ€™s method for direct service and long-term change is based on a collaborative approach which will always include the community in decision making in regards to refining our services and the creation and use of our reports and publications. Our goal is to ensure that our organization remains as transparent as possible, and that families and communities we operate with are able to provide as much feedback in regards to our operations. Whether it be through surveys, progress summaries, or Family Meetings, Educate the Future will work alongside the community to advocate on a local, state, and federal level in the field of access to high-quality education. Family Meetings will be held every month, on the last Saturday, to provide all families with direct contact to the Executive Board, being free to provide feedback and express any of their needs for additional services. Reports from this meeting will be distributed to all staff and advisers so that all levels of the organization are made aware of potential obstacles, allowing for a greater degree of input in our collaborative structure.</p>
