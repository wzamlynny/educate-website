                      <p>Educate the Future is dedicated to ensuring free, high-quality service to our families, meaning that families do not pay any form of memberships or additional fees to receive our services. In order to do so, Educate the Future depends on the generosity of individual donations and public grants to cover operational costs and resources, the support of communities to provide public spacing to conduct tutoring sessions, and the passion of volunteers to carry out our mission as staff on all levels. </p>
                    <!--<h3>How Are Funds Generated?</h3>
                      <p>Funds are generated through the fundraising arm of the organization, which is headed by the Director of Fundraising Initiatives.</p>-->
                    <h3>Financial Structure</h3>
                      <p>Educate the Future operates under a three budget system composed of a Functional, Intermediate, and Ideal Budget Model. Our Functional Budget will reflect the bare minimum of funds needed in order for us to conduct our services and events through an academic year (including winter and summer). The Intermediate Budget will display a funding level in which the organization will be able to cover all operational costs and have a financial cushion for additional costs that may occur during the course of an academic year (e.g. a family may be in need of school supplies). Lastly, the Ideal Budget will serve as a goal of funding to reach in which all operational costs are covered, there are funds for sudden financial instances, and there are remaining funds to be carried over into a reserve for the following academic year. Typically, the Intermediate Budget will be estimated to be 150% of the Functional Budget and the Ideal Budget would be 200% of the Functional Budget; for example, if the Functional Budget were to be set at $10,000 then the Intermediate Budget would be $15,000 and the Ideal Budget would be $20,000.</p>
